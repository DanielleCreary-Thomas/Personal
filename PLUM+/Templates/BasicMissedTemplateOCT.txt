KACHOW!!
{}, We hit target at 4.3% for Q2!


We missed you last week, but we still started off the new quarter strong!
Here are the store's Plum+ numbers:

Target: {}%
Store Weekly Percentage: {}%
Store Quarterly Percentage: {}%

Here's a tip from Clarissa to try out next week:

    No Automatic Renewal
    Customers are not going to get spontaneously(Looking at you Amazon) charged
    next year when their Plum+ expires. Instead, they will get migrated back
    to the regular plum card and theyâ€™ll keep their points.

Worried about not having any time on cash? E- Mail us and we can help.
