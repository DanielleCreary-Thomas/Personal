KACHOW!!
{}, We hit target at 4.3% for Q2!


We've also got a great start to the new quarter and here are
your Plum+ numbers for last week:

Sold: {}
Transactions: {}
Percentage: {}%
Target: {}%
Store Weekly Percentage: {}%
Store Quarterly Percentage: {}%

    If you have anything you tried last week that really helped you or
if you had anything you had trouble with, let us know.
    We are always open to feedback, so if there is anything you would like
to see or get from these emails, please share!

Here's a tip from Clarissa to try out next week:

    No Automatic Renewal
    Customers are not going to get spontaneously(Looking at you Amazon) charged
    next year when their Plum+ expires. Instead, they will get migrated back
    to the regular plum card and theyâ€™ll keep their points.

Worried about not having any time on cash? E- Mail us and we can help.
