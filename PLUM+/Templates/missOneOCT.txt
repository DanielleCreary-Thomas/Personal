The bell has rung, everyone to your seats!

Blank you sold {} Plum+ this week and had a total of {} transactions which
sits you right at {}%. To get to the next grade we want you to pass with at
least a 4.2% for the week, you were so close to passing this week! As
yourself what worked for you best at cash? Did you ask customers the same
way every time? Did you have cash shifts or were you jumping? Do you know all
the perks that come with the Plum Plus?
You can always ask us for tips and tricks, like 2500 pts == $500,
and any other help too!


Fret not, you still have till October 3rd to get some answers in before report
cards go out! By then we shall see if everyone goes home with all A’s and a
$75 gift card, so let’s give one big last push this week!
We ended today with 5.8%, let’s keep it up!


Please respond with the last movie or TV Show you watched!


Keep pushing, you’ve got this!
