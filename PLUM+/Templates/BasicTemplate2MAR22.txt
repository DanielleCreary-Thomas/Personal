Helpful Tip
Next week for our Opening teams we want to try '2 before 2', a challenge inspired
by some 411 greats to get 2 Plum Plus before 2pm.
We didn't forget about our closing team though, take an opportunity to really engage
with customers on the floor, even if it's just going over the plum plus when you're
helping a customer with a Kiosk order.
Whatever you may try, let one of us or an LT member know how it goes!

Benefits:
10% off of just about everything (which stacks with promos)
5pts per $1
8500pts when you sign up(which essentially brings the cost of the card to $19)
20% entire transaction birthday coupon
Early access to promos (Like Black Friday)
Members Shopping Events
Personalized Offers (Romance lovers get romance promos)
No autorenew
Keep your points after Membership expiry
