Store Quarterly Percentage: {}%

So this week is going to be a little different, because we are shifting into a
new quarterly incentive and can see this change reflected in our numbers we
wanted to change how we approach Plum+ with our customers as well!
Plum+ has so (SO MANY) surprisingly great benefits, the list is oh so long,
and we want to make sure we're sharing as much as we can as often as we can.
I'm going to include all of the current benefits here as reference.

 What we want from you this week is to try to have at least one meaningful
conversation with a customer, and share any number of benefits you feel
comfortable with (You don't have to keep them there for 20 minutes haha). This
doesn't have to be at cash, it can also be on the floor. Then, if you could
respond back to this week's email or next week's describing the
interaction.

Benefits List:
20% entire transaction birthday coupon
10% off of just about everything (which stacks with promos)
5pts per $1
8500pts when you sign up(which essentially brings the cost of the card to $19)
Early access to promos (Like Black Friday)
Members Shopping Events
Personalized Offers (Romance lovers get romance promos)
No autorenew
Keep your points after Membership expiry
