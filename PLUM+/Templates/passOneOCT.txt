Time for attendance!

{}! You just made it! You sold  {}  Plum+ this week and had a total of  {}
transactions which sits you right at {}%. Which means you’ve passed the 4.2%
and passed the class! Now it’s time to have a moment of reflection and ask
yourself, what worked this last week? Were you trying anything new? What do
I want to try next week to keep it up?
You can always ask us for tips and tricks, such as No Autorenew like stinky
Amazon, and for any other help too!

We are definitely cutting it close, but we’ve still got till October 3rd to
all pass the class and get a $75 gift card, so let’s give one big last
push this week!
We ended today with 5.8%, let’s keep it up!

Please respond with the last movie or TV Show you watched!

Celebrate this big win!
