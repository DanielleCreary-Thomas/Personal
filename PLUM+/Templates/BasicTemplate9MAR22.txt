Helpful Tip
Once a customer spends $190 the membership is free, any amount less than that
goes towards the $19 to save for the year to make back the cost of the card.

 $39  -     $20      -      $19     =        $0
(Cost)-(Bonus Points)-(%10 off $190)= A free membership

Benefits:
10% off of just about everything (which stacks with promos)
5pts per $1
8500pts when you sign up(which essentially brings the cost of the card to $19)
20% entire transaction birthday coupon
Early access to promos (Like Black Friday)
Members Shopping Events
Personalized Offers (Romance lovers get romance promos)
No autorenew
Keep your points after Membership expiry
