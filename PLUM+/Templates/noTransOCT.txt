Ring Ring Ring, class is in session!

Hey {}! We missed you last week, you didn't get an opportunity for some time
up at cash but we still want to keep you in the know.
We still have till October 3rd to hit 4.2% before report cards go out for the
year and we shall see if everyone goes home with all A’s and a $75 gift card,
so let’s give one big last push this week!
We ended today with 5.8%, let’s keep it up!

Need some help? We’ve got tutors for that!
Ask one of your Plum Plus Champions for some tips and tricks or even a coaching
session whether that be through email or in store. We also have the attached
PDF for you to look through for some help as well.

Please respond with the last movie or TV Show you watched!

Have fun hitting the books!

Danielle, Cass, Clarissa
Plum Plus Team
