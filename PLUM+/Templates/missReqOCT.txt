Ring Ring Ring, class is in session!

{} you sold  {}  Plum+ this week and had a total of  {}  transactions which
sits you right at  {}%. To get to the next grade we want you to pass with at
 least a 4.2% for the week.

We still have till October 3rd before report cards go out for the year and
we shall see if everyone goes home with all A’s and a $75 gift card, so
let’s give one big last push this week!
We ended today with 5.8%, let’s keep it up!

Need some help? We’ve got tutors for that!
Ask one of your Plum Plus Champions for some tips and tricks, like using
The Big Sign™️, or even a coaching session whether that be through email or
in store. We also have the attached PDF for you to look through for some
help as well.

Please respond with the last movie or TV Show you watched!

Have fun hitting the books!

Plum Plus Team
